Test::WWW::Jasmine
==================

This module implements Perl test runner for JavaScript test specs that use
Jasmine BDD framework. Test::WWW::Jasmine uses WWW::Selenium to run tests
in a browser, thus making possible to automatically test complex JavaScript
applications that rely heavily on DOM availability.

Test spec output is collected and converted to TAP format; from Perl
perspective Jasmine test specs look just like ordinary Perl tests.
